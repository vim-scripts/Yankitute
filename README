Yankitute combines the yank and substitute Vim commands into one. Like substitute, it searches for a pattern in the buffer and transforms all matches using a format string supplied by the user. But instead of replacing the text in the buffer with the transformed matches, it acts like yank and copies the transformed matches into a register.
